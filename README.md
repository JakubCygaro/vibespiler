# Vibespiler the vibes-based compiler!

Vibespiler is an AI powered compiler able to transpile any source code written in one language into another language
and *should* preserve its function.

## Building

### Linux

Run the provided `./build.sh` script, and use the produced `./bin/vibesc` script to run the compiler. You can also add it to your $PATH
so you can get sloppy from anywhere on your machine.

### Windows

Run the provided `./build.bat` script and use the produced `./bin/vibesc.cmd` script to run the compiler.

## USAGE

The compiler provides a help message with the `--help` flag.

**THE SLOPILER WILL NOT WORK UNLESS THE OPENAPI_API_KEY ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE IS SET TO A VALID API KEY FOR CHATGPT5-NANO**
